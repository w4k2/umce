Minority Class with Shape as Clover (examples = 600, IR = 5) data set

1: Description.

This is an artificial data set with 2 classes (the minority and the majority class) and 600 examples randomly and uniformly distributed in the two-dimensional space (both attributes were real-valued). The minority class resembles a flower with elliptic petals.

2: Type.				Imbalanced
3: Origin.				Laboratory
4: Instances.			600
5: Features.			2
6: Classes.				2
7: Missing values.		No
8: IR:					5

9: Header.
