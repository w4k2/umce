Minority Class with Rectangular Shape (examples = 600, disturbance ratio = 30%, IR = 5) data set

1: Description.

This is an artificial data set with 2 classes (the minority and the majority class) and 600 examples randomly and uniformly distributed in the two-dimensional space (both attributes were real-valued). The examples from the minority class are located inside rectangles following related works on small disjuncts. The borders of sub-regions in the minority class are disturbed increasing the ratio of borderline examples from the minority class subregions (the disturbance ratio) in 30%.
