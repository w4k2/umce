Minority Class with Shape as Paw (examples = 800, IR = 7) data set

1: Description.

This is an artificial data set with 2 classes (the minority and the majority class) and 800 examples randomly and uniformly distributed in the two-dimensional space (both attributes were real-valued). The minority class is decomposed into 3 elliptic subregions of varying cardinalities, where two subregions are located close to each other, and the remaining smaller sub-region is separated.

2: Type.				Imbalanced
3: Origin.				Laboratory
4: Instances.			800
5: Features.			2
6: Classes.				2
7: Missing values.		No
8: IR:					7

9: Header.
